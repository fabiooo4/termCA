# TermCA
TermCA is a TUI simulator for cellular automata written in Rust. It displays the
automata in the terminal and allows you to interact with the simulation in real
time.

## Simulations
The current version supports the following simulations:
- [Elementary Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
- [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)
- [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Installation
```bash
cargo install termCA
```

## Usage
When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can select
the simulation you want to run. Every screen and popup has its own set of controls that
you can see by pressing `?`.
